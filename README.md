# Intergalactic Intruders
A space invaders game with online-multiplayer, particle effects, bosses and some nice stats. Made using the [Capslock game engine](https://github.com/RetroMelon/Capslock-Game-Engine), I created it in about 2012 so the coding style might be a little sloppy.

#Demo
The I-Intruders-demo.jar file is a demo version of the game. It has cheat keys enabled to let you quickly kill all aliens on the screen, and jump to the stats screen at the end. Make sure you get to round 4 for a boss fight >:)
